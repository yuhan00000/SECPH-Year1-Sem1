## REFLECTION
I am capable to create combinational logic circuits utilizing logic gates and Boolean algebra, and I am able to apply the foundations of digital knowledge concept and numbering systems to digital logic circuits through this course. In addition, I am proficient in designing sequential synchronous and asynchronous circuits implementing the principles of flip-flops and latches. Lastly, I am able to develop and implement digital logic circuits based on real-world issues through the use of the methodologies. It allows me to see how my theoretical knowledge relates to the real world by bridging the gap between theory and application.
