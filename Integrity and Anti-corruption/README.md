# REFLECTION
I have gained knowledge of the idea of the significance of values and self-identification, as well as its applicability in promoting integrity values in the expression of national identity as a Malaysian, through this course. I can also assess different types of corruption and the consequences of power abuse in both personal and professional contexts. Additionally, I have a deep understanding of value-based science and technology that promote well-being for all.
