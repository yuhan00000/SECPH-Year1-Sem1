# REFLECTION
## ASSIGNMENT 1 POSTER
This career discussion has motivated me by emphasizing the value of self-evaluation. Understanding our own interests, strengths, and weaknesses is necessary in order to set and accomplish the ideal goal. To be competitive in the work market, we also need to be flexible enough to overcome any problem, such as keeping up with industry changes and acquiring new skills or certifications.

## ASSIGNMENT 2 VIDEO
Industry talks and visits to UTM Digital is beneficial to me. Industry visits were often attended by professionals in the field. I get to network with top employees and learn interesting information about the industry. I can also find out about recent advancements in the industry. I get knowledge about the state of the IT industry at the moment. This will help me understand and stay current with the latest technology developments. For example, the staff has shown us the teaching technologies that UTM uses and backup preparations for power outages. We also visited Bilik TM, which has Huawei IdeaHub wireless sharing and conferencing equipment installed.

## ASSIGNMENT 3 ACADEMIC REPORT
I have gained an understanding of report format by creating an academic report. As we frequently need to read a lot of journals to uncover the claims, it requires me to build research abilities such as compiling all the pertinent points and drawing a conclusion from those points. In addition, this assignment has improved my time management skills because it requires us to produce a draft first, confer with teammates a few times, and then turn in the final version within a specified period of time.

## ASSIGNMENT 4 NEWSLETTER
I've gained knowledge about the value of visual design and layout through creating a newsletter. This layout should accurately represent our claims and be easy to understand. Instead of reading the entire news, audiences frequently skim the headline. Thus, we need to make sure that the beginning to our newsletter is bombastic. Since the human brain processes visuals 30,000 times quicker than text, we might, if it's possible, incorporate multiple images. This will help the reader experience the content and be more engaged till they complete reading.

## DESIGN THINKING PROTOTYPE
Making a prototype has made me realize how important it is for us to test the viability of our concept. In order for our friends and professor to better comprehend what we are trying to say, we must first be able to communicate what we really think to them. Secondly, putting the prototype to the test on real users gives us input on the kind of quality we want the product to have. Users can express wants and expectations that we did not include in the prototype, allowing us to make improvements to the prototype and solution in order to get better results.

## DESIGN THINKING REPORT
Design thinking influences my ability to solve problems, which is how I approach an issue from multiple viewpoints and come up with comprehensive solutions. First and foremost, design thinking prioritizes creativity and innovation. For instance, after conducting a survey, we discovered that users frequently have to download several membership programs in order to obtain discounts or vouchers. Thus, we decided to propose "EzGo" as a solution to this issue because it is quite inconvenient and uses up storage. In addition, design thinking promotes testing and prototyping as a way to improve solutions. Thus, we have developed a prototype and conducted user testing to obtain input.

## PC ASSEMBLY
My knowledge of several hardware components, such as the cable, power supply, RAM, hard disk drive, and CPU fan, has increased as a result of PC assembly. My understanding of how these pieces work and interact with one another is improved by having the chance to handle the actual component. I have to give my whole attention during teaching session as the computer might not be on if some parts are not installed correctly.
